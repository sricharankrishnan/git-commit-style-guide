# git-commit-style-guide
A simple text file that I like to refer to when making git commits. Like writing good git commits. =). Was in the look out for some good content on how to write good commit details for projects. I read the articles [CBEAMS](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) and [Helder Burato at Dev.to](https://dev.to/helderburato/patterns-for-writing-better-git-commit-messages-4ba0). Borrowed file details from the page https://github.com/helderburato/dotfiles/blob/main/git/.gittemplates/commit

Happy Coding.
